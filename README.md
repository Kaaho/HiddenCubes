This is an Android app to be used with Cardboard.


You can find the installable .apk -file from folder "Installable_apk". Remember to allow microphone usage for this app in your phone's app settings!


Game instructions: Make noise to "click". Carry the three cubes to the purple area.

Mostly coded myself, although the internet helped quite a lot (e.g. how to get sound level from microphone etc.)

All graphics are basic Unity graphics.

Used sounds are CC0:
